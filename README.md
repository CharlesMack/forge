# FrameForge: Cinematic Webcam Studio üé•

Welcome to FrameForge, a powerful and accessible web application for transforming your webcam feed into cinematic-quality footage. With a simple, clean interface, you can apply professional color profiles, use advanced exposure tools, and add anamorphic effects‚Äîall in real-time.



### ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Cinematic Color Grading:** Apply built-in color profiles or upload your own **.cube LUTs** to give your video a professional, stylized look.
-   **Exposure & Metering Tools:** Use a real-time **waveform, RGB parade, and vectorscope** to monitor your video's color and luma levels. Use the **false color** and **zebras** (highlight/shadow clipping) tools for precise exposure control.
-   **Cinematic Effects:** Get that widescreen look with **anamorphic desqueeze** options and frame your shots with adjustable **aspect ratio** guides.
-   **Focus Assist:** Highlight sharp areas of your image to ensure your subject is always in perfect focus.
-   **Auto ND Filter:** Automatically adjust your exposure based on ISO and lighting conditions.
-   **High-Quality Recording:** Record directly from your browser in resolutions up to **4K** and frame rates up to **60 FPS**.
